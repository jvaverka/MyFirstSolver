# Kinematic Solver

Welcome to the Kinematic Solver.  This program is a study aid for first year Physics students.  Simply provide initial conditions for a given problem, and the solver will provide the answers you seek!

Use the **initial_conditions_full.json** file as a guide.  When you've setup your own problem run the following...

> python kinematics.py --input your_file.json

Good luck!
